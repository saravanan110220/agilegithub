Git is a powerful, open‑source version control system that helps developers track changes in code, collaborate across teams, and maintain a complete history of their projects. It’s the backbone of modern software development, used with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to share and manage code.

🔑 Key Points About Git
Version Control: Git records every change made to files, allowing you to roll back to earlier versions if needed.

Distributed System: Unlike centralized systems, every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history.

Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously, merging their contributions efficiently.

Branching & Merging: Git makes it easy to create branches for new features or experiments, then merge them back into the main project.

Speed & Efficiency: Operations like commits, diffs, and merges are optimized for performance.
